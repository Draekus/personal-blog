# About Me

Hello there! It seems you've stumbled upon my humble attempt at a tech blog. Firstly, let me introduce myself. I'm Pat, and I have an absolute passion for programming. In fact, it's safe to say that programming saved my life. At the age of 25, I found myself broke, homeless, and hopelessly addicted to drugs. My life was in shambles, and I was nothing more than a burden to those around me.

For some reason, a sudden realization struck meâ€”I needed to change my way of living. I understood that if I didn't make a change, I would end up leaving this world without contributing anything positive. Reflecting on my teenage years, I remembered being dissatisfied with life and the world, yet confident that I could make a difference. I hungered for knowledge and stood up for my beliefs.

As I looked in the mirror, pondering who I used to be, I came to the unsettling realization that I no longer recognized myself. This frightened me to my core. Determined to transform my life, I committed to getting clean and began the slow process of turning things around. I enrolled in classes at my local community college, majoring in computer science, and secured a less-than-ideal part-time job. I started running and gradually began constructing the life I desired, instead of merely letting life happen to me.

Today, at the age of 29, I hold an Associates Degree in Computer Science, am on the brink of starting as a Junior at my State University, and work as a Mathematics Tutor. Programming provided me with a second chance to pursue dreams I had long abandoned. I am writing this blog not only to share the knowledge and experience I've gained as a Computer Science student but also to share my story in the hope that it might inspire someone else. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and uplifting others, and this blog serves as my outlet for expressing that passion.
