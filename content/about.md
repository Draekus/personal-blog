Hey I'm Pat and I'm currently a student studying computer science and this is my dev blog.

For me coding isn't just a skill; it's a superpower. It's the ability to transform ideas into reality, to create, to solve problems, and to shape the future. I'm a firm believer that everyone should have access to this empowering and rewarding experience so as I learn about new technologies I post tutorials and write ups here to share that knowledge with others. 

Keep learning. Keep Hacking.
